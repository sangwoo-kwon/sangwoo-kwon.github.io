  A novel self-attention accelerator that skips most of the computation by utilizing an approximate candidate selection algorithm. Implemented in a 40nm CMOS technology, the 5.64 mm² chip operates at 100-600 MHz consuming 48.3-685 mW to achieve the energy and area efficiency of 0.354-5.61 TOPS/W and 239 GOPS/mm2, respectively.
